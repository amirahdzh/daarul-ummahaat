# API Configuration
# Set this to your backend API URL with /api prefix included
# For local development:
NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000/api

# For production:
# NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://103.59.160.131/api

# Or for your custom domain:
# NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=https://api.yourdomain.com/api

# Note: The /api prefix is already included in the base URL,
# so endpoints should not include /api prefix in the code
